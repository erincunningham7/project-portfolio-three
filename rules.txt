*********** RULES ************
1 Give the players two random cards each.
2 Check for user score.
3 An Ace is worth 11 or a 1 if the total goes over 21.
4 Only 1 Ace can change value per hand.
5 Reveal the computers cards.
6 The game ends if the user goes over 21 (Busts).
7 Ask the user if they want another card.
8 Once the user is done drawing cards it is the computers turn to get cards.
9 The computer will keep drawing cards while their total is less than 17.
10 When nobody wants any more cards compare the total.
11 Highest total wins unless the hand goes over 21 then that hand busts.
12 Because the player goes first and the computer is forced to draw while under 17 
if both hands are over 21 then it is the player that loses.
13. If the totals are the same it is a draw.
